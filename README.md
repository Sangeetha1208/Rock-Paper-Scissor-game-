Rock, paper,scissor game using html and css

This Rock Paper Scissors game is a simple yet engaging web-based project developed using only HTML and CSS. The game allows users to choose between rock, paper, or scissors and visually displays their selection alongside the computerâ€™s randomly generated choice. The interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly, offering an interactive experience without the need for JavaScript.

The layout is structured with semantic HTML elements, making the content accessible and well-organized. CSS is used extensively to style the buttons, icons, and game area, incorporating modern design techniques such as Flexbox and transitions for smooth animations. Each game option is represented with intuitive icons or images, making the game visually appealing and easy to understand.

The game emphasizes static front-end design, focusing on layout structuring, visual aesthetics, and responsive design. Although the game does not include dynamic functionality due to the absence of JavaScript, it serves as an excellent demonstration of how much can be achieved using just HTML and CSS.

This project is ideal for beginners in web development, as it showcases fundamental skills in page structure and styling. It can also be expanded in the future by integrating JavaScript to make it fully interactive.
